# Who is thi Saul Goodman?
# Hi 👋 I am Thien-Tam Nguyen, but you can call me Saul! 
I am a graduate student at the Dept. of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, NDSU (Fargo ND). As a highly motivated and skilled problem-solver, I possess a solid foundation in Physics (Computational and Bio) and Mathematics. My diverse experience includes training in Molecular Dynamics and High Performance Computing during my undergrad, and working at Viettel Aerospace Institute where I was introduced to Continuum Methodology. After spending over two years applying this technique in the aerospace field, I realized my passion for developing a hybrid continuum-particle approach and decided to pursue an M.Sc. degree. Throughout my advanced studies, I have not only gained a deep understanding of my desired field but also acquired expertise in Machine Learning and Cell Mechanics. With my diverse skill set and strong academic background, I am confident that I can make valuable contributions to any organization I work with.
